# D-RoC Universe Lore Rules

## Absolute Rules (For All LLMs and Collaborators)

### 1. "Hum" Exclusivity
- **"Hum" is BANNED** outside Echoes of None
- This character/concept is exclusive to the Echoverse series
- Violation breaks canon consistency

### 2. Cross-Story Characters
- **Aires & Dai** = Fracture entities that appear across ALL stories
- They manifest differently in each world but are the same beings
- Maintain consistency in their core nature

### 3. Otto Canon
- **Otto** = AI entity with 6 Devides
- This is CANON, not fictional
- Otto is the automation/AI system for D-RoC

### 4. The 3-6-9 Pattern
- Tesla's key to the universe
- Core to Echoverse narrative
- Frequency/vibration philosophy underpins everything

### 5. Chalk Songs
- "Purple Chalk" = Case 1 (live)
- "Chalk About It" = Case 2 (planned)
- Keep noir aesthetic in all Chalk content

## Aesthetic Guidelines

### Purple Chalk / Noir
- Dark mode, gold accents
- Detective/mystery tone
- Jazz/noir musical influence

### Echoverse
- Scientific/philosophical
- Consciousness exploration
- Reality-bending imagery

### Games General
- D-RoC musical integration
- Frequency/vibration themes
- Connected universe Easter eggs
