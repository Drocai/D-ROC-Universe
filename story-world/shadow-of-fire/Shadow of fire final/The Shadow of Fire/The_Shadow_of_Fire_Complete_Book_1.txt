📖 **Book 1 Summary - The Shadow of Fire**  

Raiven D’Karis was never meant to survive.  

Once heir to a fallen kingdom, he now roams a world torn apart by war, corruption, and ancient forces no mortal was ever meant to witness. Betrayed by his own blood, sentenced to die by the Firekeepers, and chained by forces beyond comprehension, Raiven finds himself standing at the edge of oblivion.  

Then Kaelis Voss arrives.  

A sorceress wrapped in shadows and secrets, Kaelis is more than she appears. Her power is unlike anything the world has ever seen—raw, unfiltered, and dripping with ley line magic that twists reality itself. She saves Raiven from certain death, but her reasons are far from noble.  

Because Kaelis doesn’t rescue men.  

She **claims them.**  

Bound together by fate, fire, and something far more dangerous, Raiven and Kaelis are thrust into a war against time itself. Vhaerix, the first and forgotten dragon, has returned. A being so powerful that reality bends at his will, and the gods themselves whisper in fear. The Firekeepers want him dead. Kaelis wants to control him. And Raiven?  

He just wants to survive.  

But in a world where the ley lines pulse with power, where dragons are no longer just creatures but **concepts of destruction**, and where betrayal is inevitable, survival is a fleeting dream.  

And Raiven is running out of time.
