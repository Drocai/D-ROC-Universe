🔥 **Kaelis and Raiven’s First Power Struggle** (Chapter 3) 🔥  

Raiven **moved before he could think.** His hands found **Kaelis’s throat, slamming her back against the nearest pillar, the stone cracking beneath the force.**  

Her breath hitched, a sharp gasp that was **half shock, half something else.**  

"You’re letting it take you," he snarled. His grip tightened. "You think this thing makes you stronger?"  

Kaelis **smiled.** Not afraid. Not resisting. **Amused.**  

"Stronger?" she echoed, tilting her head slightly. "Raiven… I am beyond strong."  

Then—she moved.  

One moment, his grip was firm around her throat. The next, **she twisted free, reversing their positions, slamming him against the same pillar with bone-crushing force.**  

Her body was **flush against his now**, the heat between them **unnatural**, crackling with the ley line energy that **twisted inside both of them.**  

Raiven gritted his teeth, his blood pounding like war drums. **Not like this. Not her.**  

But she saw the hesitation. And **she reveled in it.**  

"You feel it, don’t you?" she whispered, her breath hot against his ear. "The power. The hunger. You think you can fight it, but it’s already inside you, Raiven. It’s always been inside you."  

Her fingers **trailed lower**, tracing the lines of his scars, the marks of his past, the places where **he had been burned and reforged in blood.**  

"You want to stop me?" she murmured. "Then take me down."  

🔥 **The Ley Lines Ignite** (Chapter 4) 🔥  

Raiven’s veins **burned.** The ley lines were **inside him now**, twisting, shifting, demanding something he didn’t understand.  

Kaelis felt it too. **She welcomed it.**  

Her fingers curled around his wrist, guiding his hand **lower, against the pulse of energy in her chest.**  

"Don’t fight it," she whispered.  

His breath caught. The power was **unstoppable, unbearable.**  

And then, the **Firekeepers attacked.**  

🔥 **The Breaking Point** (Upcoming) 🔥  

The ley lines shattered. **Raiven and Kaelis were no longer human.**  

And the world would never recover.
