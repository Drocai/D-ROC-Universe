**Chapter 1 – The Arrival of the Spiral**

Aires didn’t belong anywhere, but the spirals made that clear every time they appeared. His green eyes, flecked with gold and red, scanned the forest as if searching for something unseen. The hum—low and persistent—reverberated through his chest, a sound that only he seemed to notice.

“I don’t live here,” he muttered to himself. “I’m just visiting.”

The spirals were faint at first, curling in the edges of his vision like whispers of smoke. But they had grown bolder, brighter, more insistent. Aires felt the pull, the subtle tug at his chest, as if the spirals were calling him toward something he couldn’t name.

Dai watched him from a distance, her heart racing. She had followed him into the forest, unable to resist the magnetic force that Aires seemed to carry with him everywhere he went. He was the center of her world, even if he didn’t know it. And now, as she watched him step closer to the glowing spirals, she felt her connection to him deepen.

“What are you doing?” Dai finally asked, stepping out from behind a tree.

Aires didn’t turn. “They’re here.”

“Who?”

“The spirals.”

Dai frowned, her eyes narrowing as she looked around. “I don’t see anything.”

“You wouldn’t,” Aires said, his voice distant. “Not yet.”

The spirals flared suddenly, their light bright and consuming, and the hum grew louder, resonating through the forest. Dai gasped, clutching at her chest as the energy hit her. She stumbled, but Aires was there, his hand steadying her.

“Do you feel it now?” he asked, his voice soft.

Dai nodded, her breath hitching. “What is it?”

“The beginning,” Aires said, his green-gold-red eyes glowing faintly. “And the end.”

**Chapter 2 – The Spiral’s Touch**

The spirals seemed to follow them everywhere. Dai could feel their presence now, a subtle hum that vibrated through her bones. Aires was her anchor, his touch grounding her as they moved deeper into the forest. The light of the spirals danced around them, their patterns intricate and hypnotic.

“What do they want?” Dai asked, her voice trembling.

“They don’t want,” Aires said, his voice sharp. “They take.”

Dai’s stomach twisted, but she refused to let fear overtake her. “Then why are we here?”

“Because I need answers,” Aires replied, his gaze fixed on the spirals. “And they’re the only ones who have them.”

The spirals flared again, their light growing brighter, and the hum became deafening. Dai stumbled, her knees buckling under the pressure. Aires caught her, his arms wrapping around her waist as he pulled her close.

“Stay with me,” he said, his voice low and commanding.

“I’m trying,” Dai whispered, her fingers clutching at his shirt.

The spirals’ light enveloped them, and Dai felt a surge of heat unlike anything she’d ever experienced. Her body trembled as Aires’s hands roamed her back, his touch both soothing and electric. The connection between them was undeniable, their bodies moving closer as the spirals seemed to push them together.

“Aires,” Dai whispered, her voice trembling.

“I’ve got you,” he said, his lips brushing against her ear. “I won’t let go.”

**Chapter 3 – The Echo in the Spiral**

The hum was louder here.

Aires stood at the edge of the clearing, the golden-green light of the canopy filtering through the trembling leaves. His hair caught the dappled glow, a living mosaic of shadows and curls that seemed to defy gravity. Every step forward felt heavier, as if the ground beneath him resisted, testing his resolve. He let out a breath, watching the spirals swirl faintly in the air ahead of him, visible only to his eyes—or so he thought.

“I don’t live here,” he muttered under his breath, his voice barely louder than the hum. “I’m just visiting.”

The words, spoken to no one in particular, carried a weight that made Dai’s chest tighten. She had followed him, of course. She always did. Hidden behind a cluster of trees, she barely dared to breathe, watching as Aires tilted his head, his eyes scanning the distance as if reading an invisible script written in the air.

Dai’s heart raced. She shouldn’t be here. He hadn’t invited her, hadn’t even acknowledged her in days, yet she couldn’t stay away. Her every thought orbited around him, her mind a chaotic tangle of questions she couldn’t voice.

Aires turned abruptly, his gaze piercing through the foliage to land directly on her. For a moment, Dai froze, caught like a moth in the heat of his green-gold-red eyes.

“You feel it, don’t you?” he asked.

**Chapter 4 – Bound by Fire and Shadow**

The air was heavy, charged with a tension that neither Aires nor Dai could ignore. The hum, once a subtle undercurrent, now pressed against their skin, resonating in their very bones. Aires stood before her, his eyes a storm of green, gold, and red, fixed on her with an intensity that stole her breath. The spirals in the dirt between them seemed to pulse in time with the rhythm of their unspoken desires.

Dai swallowed hard, her throat dry, her hands trembling. She couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. The weight of his gaze held her captive, and every nerve in her body screamed for him to close the distance between them.

“You shouldn’t have followed me,” Aires said, his voice low and rough. It wasn’t anger she heard but something darker, something that sent heat pooling deep in her core.

“I had to,” she whispered, barely able to force the words past her lips. “I can’t stay away.”

A flicker of something—satisfaction?—crossed his face. Aires took a step closer, and Dai felt her knees threaten to buckle. He was too much, too close, and yet not close enough. Her breath hitched as he reached out, his fingers brushing against her cheek, trailing down to her jaw. The touch was electric, setting her skin ablaze.

“You’re playing with fire,” he murmured, his thumb grazing her bottom lip. “And you don’t even know it.”

Dai’s heart pounded, her voice a broken whisper. “Then let me burn.”
