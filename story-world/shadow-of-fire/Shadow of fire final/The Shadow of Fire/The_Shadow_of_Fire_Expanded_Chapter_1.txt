The Shadow of Fire
----------------------------------
**Chapter 1: Ash and Ruin**

Raiven D’Karis could still taste the blood in his mouth when the Firekeepers dragged him to the pyre.

His arms were bound behind his back with iron laced in dragonbone—a material that burned against his skin, sapping the last remnants of power from his veins. They wanted him weak. They wanted him afraid. But he refused to give them the satisfaction.

The air was thick with the scent of burning flesh. Around him, his men were being thrown onto the flames, their screams curling into the night air like offerings to gods who no longer cared. He did not look away. They had followed him into the abyss, and now, they were paying the price.

A heavy boot slammed into the back of his knees, forcing him to the ground. The stone beneath him was slick with blood, warm and fresh. He lifted his gaze, locking eyes with the one who had betrayed him.

**High Lord Vaelin D’Karis.**

His father.

“You should have stayed loyal,” Vaelin murmured, his voice like cold steel. “But you had to question everything. And now, you’ll die knowing that the Firekeepers will never fall.”

Raiven spat blood onto his father’s boots. “Then why are you so afraid of me?”

A flicker of something dark passed through Vaelin’s expression. He turned away, motioning to the executioner. “Burn him.”

The Firekeepers surged forward, their red robes whipping in the wind. One of them grabbed Raiven’s hair, yanking his head back to expose his throat. Another lifted a blade, ready to carve the Firekeeper sigil into his chest—**a final mark of shame before the flames took him.**

But then, the screaming started.

Not from his men. Not from the prisoners.

From the **Firekeepers.**

Raiven felt the shift in the air before he saw her. The scent of steel and burnt ozone. The whisper of death curling at the edges of the wind.

Then, the **heads began to fall.**

A Firekeeper to his left was sliced clean through the throat, arterial spray painting the stone. Another’s ribs split open as a black blade carved through his chest, **his lungs spilling onto the ground in wet, glistening ropes.** The executioner raised his hands to cast a spell, but a dagger buried itself in his eye socket before he could utter the incantation.

**Kaelis Voss had arrived.**

Raiven watched her cut through the Firekeepers like they were **nothing but parchment beneath a hot blade.** Her movements were brutal, efficient—**a shadow given form.** She fought without hesitation, without mercy, and without the weight of regret.

Within seconds, the execution site was **a graveyard.**

Vaelin stepped forward, gripping his sword. “Voss,” he spat. “I should have known you’d crawl out of the dark.”

Kaelis tilted her head, wiping blood from her cheek with the back of her hand. “Still talking like you’re important, Vaelin? It’s cute.”

Vaelin lunged.

Kaelis dodged, **faster than any human should be.** Her blade met his in a shower of sparks, the force of the impact sending shockwaves through the courtyard. Raiven saw it then—**Vaelin was struggling.**

Kaelis was **stronger.** Faster. **Something more than human.**

Vaelin must have realized it too, because for the first time in his life, **he hesitated.**

And that was all she needed.

Her blade found his throat.

Silence.

Vaelin’s body crumpled to the stone.

Kaelis exhaled sharply, flicking the blood from her sword. Then, she turned to Raiven, stepping over corpses as if they were no more than fallen leaves.

“You’re alive,” she mused, crouching in front of him.

Raiven held her gaze. “You going to fix that?”

She smirked. “Not yet.”

Then, with a flick of her wrist, she **sliced through his bindings.**

The moment his hands were free, he surged forward, grabbing her by the throat and slamming her against the stone pillar behind them. He should have been weaker. He should have been exhausted.

But something in him had ignited.

And he knew she felt it too.

Kaelis’s lips parted slightly, her pulse hammering against his palm. “Oh,” she murmured, tilting her head slightly. “Are we playing now?”

Raiven’s grip tightened. He should kill her. He should tear the life from her throat for everything she had done.

Instead, he leaned in, his breath hot against her ear. “You didn’t come here for me.”

Kaelis smirked against his skin. “No.”

And then, a shadow passed over them.

A shadow with **wings.**

A roar split the night, shaking the foundations of the ruins.

Raiven’s blood ran cold.

The sky burned as a **dragon descended from the clouds, its obsidian scales reflecting the fire below.**

Kaelis grinned. “I came for him.”

**Vhaerix had arrived.**

And the war was just beginning.

---

The ground **shattered beneath them** as Vhaerix landed, his massive talons splitting the stone. He did not roar again—he did not need to. The air itself trembled at his presence.

Raiven had **seen dragons before.** He had even fought against them.

But this? This was **something else.**

Vhaerix’s eyes were **not the golden or amber hues of lesser dragons**—they burned **violet**, flickering like dying stars. His scales rippled with shadows, twisting in and out of reality. **He did not simply exist in this world. He was beyond it.**

The Firekeepers that remained began **to run.**

Kaelis chuckled. “Oh, now they run?”

Raiven barely heard her. His pulse thundered in his ears.

Vhaerix turned to him.

The dragon’s gaze settled, unblinking.

And then—**Raiven heard its voice.**

A voice **not of sound, but of thought.**

*"Your blood is not yet burned. But it will be."*

The moment shattered.

Vhaerix **moved.**

Not flew. Not walked. He **became a storm.**

Raiven had no time to think—only to react. He dove, rolling as **a burst of violet fire incinerated the space where he had stood.** The heat was unbearable—**not just flame, but something deeper. Something that burned the soul.**

Kaelis moved beside him, her movements precise, calculated. She was **not afraid.**

Raiven **was.**

For the first time since his exile, **he was afraid.**

Vhaerix had come.

And he was **not here to be tamed.**
