The Shadow of Fire

**Chapter 5: The Fall of the First God**

The god-killer moved.  

It wasn’t fast. It wasn’t **designed** to be fast. It was **inevitable.**  

Molten veins pulsed beneath its armor, **carved from the bones of dragons lost to time.** Its core—a heart forged from a **dead ley line, corrupted and hungry.** This was not just a weapon.  

**This was an executioner.**  

And Vhaerix **was the sentence.**  

The beast reared back, violet eyes narrowing, the pulse of reality **fracturing** around him. For the first time since he had emerged from the abyss…  

**He hesitated.**  

Then—**impact.**  

The blast struck **dead center**, spearing through **scale, flesh, and something deeper.**  

For one impossible moment, **the world went silent.**  

And then—**Vhaerix screamed.**  

It was not a roar. It was **the wail of something ancient, something that should never have been touched.** The sky **blackened**, the ley lines **shuddered**, the very **concept of time twisted on itself.**  

Raiven’s breath caught. The heat was **unbearable.**  

Vhaerix was **dying.**  

Or worse.  

**He was changing.**

🔥 **What Happens Next?** 🔥  

- **Chapter 6:** **Kaelis and Raiven are fully corrupted by the ley lines.** Their humanity is **unraveling.**  
- **Chapter 7:** **Vhaerix’s true form is revealed.** This was never just a dragon—this was **something beyond gods.**  
- **Chapter 8:** **The final cliffhanger—the betrayal, the ascension, and the breaking of the world.**

🔥 **Next Steps:**  
🔥 **Do we let Vhaerix fully transform into something beyond comprehension?**  
🔥 **Does Raiven finally lose himself, crossing the final line with Kaelis?**  
🔥 **Does the Firekeepers’ weapon have another secret—something even Kaelis wasn’t prepared for?**  

Tell me, and I will push **Chapter 6** to the MAXIMUM limit now. 🚀🔥
