🔥 **Structured MidJourney Image Prompts for *The Shadow of Fire*** 🔥  

### **Character Prompts**  
📌 **Raiven D’Karis** (The Forsaken Heir)  
_A powerful warrior with long, flowing silver hair and piercing silver eyes, his body marked with burning ley line scars. He stands on a battlefield, his muscles tensed, gripping a sword crackling with unstable magic. The wind whips his hair wildly, and the fractured sky behind him reveals swirling cosmic fire. His face is rugged, intense, and haunted._  

📌 **Kaelis Voss** (The Shadow-Woven Sorceress)  
_A dark sorceress with flowing black hair and glowing violet eyes, her body wrapped in tendrils of shadow magic. She stands on a ruined temple, smirking, as ley line energy crackles around her fingertips. Her expression is unreadable—dangerous, intelligent, and untouchable._  

📌 **Vhaerix** (The Hollow God)  
_A massive, eldritch dragon with shifting, fractal wings that bend reality itself. His violet eyes burn with an unnatural glow, and his body is both solid and liquid, phasing in and out of existence. Above him, the sky is fractured, and the world trembles beneath his presence._  

### **Scene Prompts**  
📌 **Raiven and Kaelis' Power Struggle**  
_The warrior Raiven has Kaelis pinned against an ancient stone wall, his silver eyes burning with anger, his grip firm around her throat. She smirks up at him, her violet-lit eyes flickering with both defiance and something deeper. The air crackles with ley line magic, firelight flickering in the background._  

📌 **Vhaerix's Awakening**  
_The ground splits open as Vhaerix emerges, his violet eyes piercing through the smoke. The world bends and fractures around him, his form too powerful for reality to contain. Ancient ruins crumble as his wings unfold, breaking the sky itself._  

📌 **The Final Betrayal**  
_Kaelis stands before Raiven, her silver eyes now fully violet, her fingers raised as she bends reality itself. Raiven's body is frozen mid-motion, his face contorted in shock and rage as he realizes he has been betrayed. Behind them, the ley lines twist and crack, consuming the battlefield._  

📌 **Raiven Trapped in the Void**  
_Raiven drifts in endless darkness, his body weightless, suspended in a sea of swirling energy. His silver hair floats around him, his expression both lost and enraged. The shadows whisper around him, forming into Kaelis’s shape for just a moment before fading away._  

📌 **Kaelis and Vhaerix’s Ascension**  
_Kaelis stands at the center of a ley line explosion, her body glowing with raw power, her hair rising like smoke. Behind her, Vhaerix looms, no longer a dragon, but something beyond comprehension—shifting, fractal, infinite._
