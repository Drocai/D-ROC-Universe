**Chapter 3: The Breaking Point**

The moment Vhaerix moved, the world **broke.**

Raiven didn’t see it. He **felt it.** A force **so vast, so incomprehensible** that for a split second, he wasn’t standing in the ruins of a battlefield—he was **everywhere and nowhere.** The **ley lines screamed, twisting, unraveling.** The **sky fractured like glass**, violet flames licking at the edges of reality.  

And then—**sound.**  

A roar that wasn’t just **heard** but **felt inside his bones.**  

Raiven dropped to a knee, his lungs burning, his pulse hammering in his ears. This wasn’t dragonfire. This wasn’t magic.  

**This was something beyond both.**  

Kaelis, of course, was **still standing.**  

She stood before the beast, the **wind whipping through her dark hair, her silver eyes locked onto the creature that should not exist.**  

And Vhaerix was **looking back.**  

A whisper—inside Raiven’s head, deep and guttural. **Ancient. Mocking.**  

*"You are nothing."*  

His breath hitched. His hands trembled.  

He had fought Firekeepers, faced execution, bled in the shadows of war. But this?  

This was **true fear.**  

And Kaelis **knew it.**  

She turned slightly, just enough for Raiven to see the smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. **Like she had been waiting for this moment.** Like she had been waiting for **him** to finally understand **what she was.**  

"You feel it now, don’t you?" she murmured. Her voice was soft, but it cut through the roar, through the wind, through the chaos **like a blade to the throat.**  

Raiven forced himself to stand, his vision swimming. "You… you brought him back."  

Kaelis’s smirk widened. "Oh, Raiven. I didn’t just bring him back."  

She lifted a hand—**and Vhaerix moved.**  

The dragon's massive head dipped lower, his violet eyes locked onto **her** now. He **wasn’t just listening. He was obeying.**  

Raiven's stomach twisted. "You control him?"  

Kaelis laughed. "No. That would imply he wasn’t willing."  

The words hit harder than any blade.  

Vhaerix had **chosen her.**  

Raiven’s fists clenched, heat rushing through his veins. The ley lines around them trembled—**responding to him. To his anger. To his fire.**  

And Kaelis saw it. She **felt it.**  

Her gaze flickered over him, slow, **assessing.** The same way a predator watches another predator.  

Then—**she stepped closer.**  

Raiven didn’t move. He couldn’t. Not because he was afraid. But because he **refused to be the one who backed down.**  

Kaelis lifted a hand, tracing her fingers down his chest—**over his scars, his wounds, his war-torn body.**  

"You’re stronger than I thought," she murmured. "But you’re still not ready."  

His breath hitched. His muscles locked.  

She leaned in, close enough that he could feel the heat of her breath against his throat.  

"Let me show you what real power feels like."  

Then—**the sky ignited.**

🔥 **What Happens Next?** 🔥  

- **Vhaerix does something that should not be possible—bending time, shattering ley lines, changing the war itself.**  
- **The Firekeepers attack.** And they do not come with mere soldiers. They come with **weapons designed to kill gods.**  
- **Kaelis and Raiven’s bond spirals into something neither of them fully controls—power, rage, attraction, and destruction woven into one.**  
- **War has begun. And the world will never be the same.**
