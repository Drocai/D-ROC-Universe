🔥 **Ultimate MidJourney Image Prompts for *The Shadow of Fire*** 🔥  

### **Main Character Prompts**  
📌 **Raiven D’Karis – The Forsaken Heir**  
_A towering, battle-hardened warrior with long, flowing silver hair, piercing silver eyes, and a body marked with glowing ley line scars that pulse beneath his skin. He stands amidst a burning battlefield, his muscular frame tense as he grips a massive obsidian sword crackling with unstable energy. His silver hair whips wildly in the storm, illuminated by cosmic fire as fractured ley lines twist the sky behind him. His face is rugged, scarred, and filled with an intensity that hints at both power and tragedy._  

📌 **Kaelis Voss – The Shadow-Woven Sorceress**  
_A dark and dangerously alluring sorceress, her cascading black hair flowing like liquid shadow. Her violet-lit eyes flicker with eldritch fire, filled with intelligence, amusement, and something more dangerous—control. She stands atop an ancient, ruined temple, her form wrapped in a flowing, rune-inscribed cloak that shimmers with shifting ley line magic. One hand is raised, fingers weaving an intricate spell, while the air around her distorts as raw power crackles in violet tendrils. Her presence warps the world around her._  

📌 **Vhaerix – The Hollow God**  
_A being that defies mortal comprehension, no longer bound by a single form. His body is an ever-shifting mass of dark scales, glowing violet fissures of energy splitting through his form like cracks in reality. His jagged wings stretch beyond the fabric of existence, their edges tearing at time itself. His multiple, burning violet eyes move independently, watching past, present, and future all at once. His breath distorts the air, his presence bending the laws of creation. Above him, the sky fractures, revealing the abyss of endless, swirling void._

### **Cinematic Scene Prompts**  
📌 **Raiven and Kaelis’ Power Struggle**  
_Raiven has Kaelis pinned against the crumbling stone wall of an ancient fortress, his long silver hair tangled from battle, his silver eyes locked onto hers with a mix of fury and something deeper. His powerful hands grip her throat, pressing her against the cracked stone. She does not struggle—her violet-lit eyes burn with amusement, her lips curving into a smirk as unstable ley line energy crackles around them. Sparks of violet lightning coil between their bodies, shadows dancing in the firelight as the storm of magic threatens to consume them both._  

📌 **Vhaerix's Awakening**  
_The ground rips apart as Vhaerix emerges, his sheer size bending the very laws of nature. His violet-burning eyes pierce through the smoke and fire, his jagged, shifting wings blotting out the sky. The ruins of an ancient civilization crumble beneath his rise, ley lines rupturing in a violent surge of energy. His roar does not simply echo—it distorts reality itself, a call to war that is felt in the bones of every living thing. The sky above him fractures, revealing an infinite abyss._  

📌 **The Final Betrayal**  
_Kaelis stands before Raiven, her expression unreadable, her silver eyes now entirely violet, overflowing with power. Reality itself bends around her as she raises a single hand, fingers curling as she casts the spell that will seal his fate. Raiven is frozen mid-motion, his silver eyes wide with fury and betrayal as the ley lines around them twist, warping the battlefield into something unrecognizable. His silver hair is wild, tangled from battle, his form flickering between existence and the void as Kaelis whispers the final words that will break him._  

📌 **Raiven Trapped in the Void**  
_Raiven floats in a sea of absolute nothingness, his body weightless, his long silver hair drifting like ghostly strands. He reaches out, but his fingers grasp only the abyss. His silver eyes glow faintly, filled with anger, desperation, and something deeper—acceptance. The shadows around him whisper, forming into indistinct shapes—Kaelis, Vhaerix, fragments of a world that no longer exists. The background is endless, black cosmic fire flickering like distant stars in an abyss where time does not exist._  

📌 **Kaelis and Vhaerix’s Ascension**  
_Kaelis stands at the center of a ley line explosion, her form no longer entirely human. Her body is wreathed in violet fire, her midnight-black hair floating weightlessly as raw power warps the space around her. Behind her, Vhaerix looms, his jagged, fractal wings now infinite, shifting between dimensions, his many violet eyes burning with an intelligence older than time itself. The battlefield trembles, no longer bound by mortal constraints. This is no longer a war—it is a moment of divine ascension._
