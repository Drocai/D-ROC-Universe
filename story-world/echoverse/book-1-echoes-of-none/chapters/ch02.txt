# Chapter 2: Duality of Desire

The hum settled into a low vibration, resonating deep in Aires's chest as he walked through the rain-drenched streets. The twin pulses synchronized with his heartbeat now, creating a rhythm that felt both foreign and intimately familiar. The spirals were gone, but the lingering pulse they left behind throbbed beneath his ribs like phantom lovers' hands. The numbers—3, 6, 9—echoed in his mind, a riddle threading itself through the fabric of his thoughts, each digit paired with its phantom double.

Rain clung to his skin, droplets tracing seductive paths down the column of his throat and disappearing beneath the collar of his shirt. The cool moisture against his heated skin created a delicious contrast of sensation. Fractured reflections of neon lights shimmered across puddles, splitting reality into two parallel worlds—one above, one below. Aires didn't choose his path—he simply moved, his powerful body obeying the pull that led him forward, silent and unrelenting, his muscles flexing beneath damp fabric with each deliberate stride.

He stopped outside a bar, its sign flickering weakly above the doorway, casting alternating shadows that danced across his chiseled features. The air around him buzzed faintly, a vibration he felt more than heard, like invisible fingers trailing along his skin. Aires didn't frequent places like this, but tonight, the hum wasn't asking. It was leading, pulling him toward one of the two revelations that awaited him in the darkness.

---

The room inside wrapped around him like a second skin, warm and heavy with the scents of whiskey, wood smoke, and damp leather. The atmosphere clung to him, sensual and thick. Aires paused in the doorway, his broad shoulders cutting through the dim light as he scanned the space, the tight black t-shirt revealing every ridge and valley of his torso as he breathed.

Eyes flicked toward him, some briefly, others lingering. Aires didn't acknowledge the attention, but he felt it, a ripple of quiet intrigue spreading through the room, the weight of desire pressing against him from all sides.

Women noticed.

They always did.

Some glanced away quickly, their cheeks flushing with the heat of unspoken thoughts, imagining how those large, scarred hands might feel against their skin. Others let their gazes linger, drawn to the rain-damp curls that framed his face, the sharp angles of his jaw, the way his leather jacket stretched across his shoulders, hinting at the strength beneath. A brunette at a corner table unconsciously licked her lips, her fingers tightening around her glass. A blonde by the jukebox shifted in her seat, crossing and uncrossing her legs as he passed. Aires moved through it all as if unaware, his strides slow, deliberate, each movement a display of controlled power.

Sliding onto a stool at the bar, Aires leaned forward, his scarred fingers curling loosely around the polished wood. The veins in his forearms stood out against bronze skin, a road map of strength that drew more than one appreciative glance.

"Whiskey," he said, his voice low, deliberate, the kind of voice that rumbled in a woman's chest long after he'd stopped speaking.

The bartender nodded, sliding a glass toward him. Aires took it, the amber liquid catching the dim light and fracturing it into shards of gold. He lifted the glass to his lips, savoring the heat that spread through him as the whiskey burned down his throat, the muscles in his neck working as he swallowed.

And then, he felt her.

---

She sat at the far end of the bar, her fiery hair falling over her shoulders in loose, shimmering waves like liquid flame. Aires hadn't noticed her at first—but now she consumed his vision, as if the world had split into two distinct halves: her, and everything else. Her presence radiated power, her posture relaxed yet purposeful as she traced the rim of her glass with a slow, hypnotic rhythm. Her fingernails, painted a deep burgundy, gleamed in the low light as they moved with practiced precision.

Dai didn't look at him, but Aires felt the pull between them, a taut thread tightening with every breath. The hum in his chest responded to her presence, splitting into two distinct vibrations that played against each other like competing melodies.

"You always stare like that?"

Her voice cut through the air, smooth and edged with quiet amusement. She didn't look up immediately, her attention still on her glass, but her words carried the weight of someone who already knew the answer. The curve of her neck as she bent slightly forward was an invitation in itself, pale skin begging to be touched.

"Not often," Aires replied, his voice calm but quieter now, the deep timbre sending a visible shiver through a woman seated nearby.

She turned then, her green eyes locking onto his. They burned with an intensity that seemed to strip away the noise of the bar, leaving only the space between them, charged and electric. Her lips curved faintly, not quite a smile but enough to make Aires lean forward, his grip on the glass tightening. Full, lush lips painted the same deep burgundy as her nails, a mouth made for sin and secrets.

"Lucky me," she said softly, lifting her drink to her lips with a motion so smooth it bordered on sensual. The way her throat moved as she swallowed made Aires's pulse quicken, heat spreading through his core.

Aires didn't respond immediately. His gaze lingered, tracing the curve of her neck, the soft rise and fall of her chest, the way her silk blouse clung to the generous swell of her breasts. The top two buttons were undone, revealing a tantalizing glimpse of creamy skin and the delicate gold chain that disappeared between them. Everything about her felt deliberate, as if every movement was calculated to hold his attention, to make him imagine things he shouldn't.

"What's your name?" he asked finally, his voice low, deliberate, a rumble that seemed to vibrate through the space between them.

"Dai," she said simply, tilting her head slightly. Her fiery hair shifted with the motion, catching the light like molten copper. The movement exposed the elegant column of her neck, a stretch of pale skin that drew his gaze like a magnet. "And you?"

"Aires."

Her green eyes studied him, flicking over the sharp angles of his face, the quiet power in the way he held himself. Her gaze lingered on his mouth, his broad shoulders, the strong hands wrapped around his glass. Her smirk deepened, a knowing look that suggested she saw far more than he was showing.

"You don't look like you belong here," she said, her voice calm but edged with curiosity. One finger traced an idle pattern on the bar between them, each movement drawing his attention to her slender hands, making him wonder how they would feel against his skin.

"Neither do you," Aires replied, his tone steady, his gaze locked on hers. A muscle in his jaw twitched, the only sign of the tension building within him, of the effort it took to remain still under her scrutiny.

Dai laughed softly, the sound brief but electric, sending a jolt down Aires's spine that settled low in his abdomen. She leaned forward slightly, her movements slow and intentional, giving him a deeper view of the shadow between her breasts. "Fair enough," she said, her voice dropping just enough to make Aires's pulse quicken, his blood heating in his veins.

---

The air between them thickened, alive with tension that buzzed against Aires's skin like electricity. Dai leaned closer, her green eyes narrowing slightly as her lips curved again, this time softer, more inviting. The scent of her perfume reached him—something dark and sweet, like blackberries and vanilla, with an underlying musk that made his nostrils flare.

"You feel it, don't you?" she asked, her voice quieter now, more intimate, meant only for him despite the crowded bar around them.

Aires's jaw tightened, his pulse quickening as heat pooled in his core. "Feel what?" His voice was rougher now, the control slipping as the twin vibrations in his chest intensified, syncing with the rhythm of his accelerating heartbeat.

"The pull," she said simply, her voice steady, her lips barely moving as the words slid between them like a secret confession. "It's been calling to you. Just like it's been calling to me."

Her hand brushed against his, the briefest contact, but it sent a charge through him that tightened every muscle in his body. The touch was feather-light but burned like a brand against his skin. Aires didn't move, but his breathing shifted, deepened, as the hum inside him roared to deafening heights. His pupils dilated, darkening his eyes as they remained fixed on hers.

Dai leaned even closer, her breath brushing against his ear, warm and moist. "I thought so," she murmured, her tone laced with heat that made his skin prickle and tighten. Her lips grazed the shell of his ear, sending a shock wave of sensation straight to his core.

She pulled back slightly, her lips inches from his as her hand rested lightly on his forearm. Her fingers traced the veins there, following their path up to where his sleeve ended, her touch leaving trails of fire in its wake. Aires's chest rose and fell in slow, deliberate breaths, his green eyes locked on hers as the pull between them grew unbearable, a tether straining to its breaking point.

"Come with me," Dai said softly, her fingers curling around his wrist, her thumb pressing against his pulse point, feeling the rapid beat of his heart beneath his skin.

Aires stood, towering over her, the hum inside him vibrating at a near-deafening pitch. His thighs brushed against hers as he moved, creating a momentary pressure that made her eyes darken. Dai smirked, her green eyes glinting with something primal and knowing as she turned toward the door, her hips swaying in a hypnotic rhythm that made his chest tighten further, his body responding to her in ways he couldn't control.

They stepped out into the rain-drenched night, the city stretching out before them in fractured light and shadow, split into twin realities by the reflections in the puddles at their feet. Dai stopped in the alley, turning to face him, her fiery hair catching the dim glow of a streetlamp. Raindrops glistened on her skin, trailing down her neck and disappearing beneath her blouse, drawing his gaze.

"Close your eyes," she whispered, stepping closer until her body was a whisper away from his. Her hand pressed lightly against his chest, feeling the hard muscle beneath, the thundering of his heart. Her breath was warm against his neck, a stark contrast to the cool rain falling around them.

Aires hesitated, his jaw tightening as the hum surged through him, shaking him to his core. Two frequencies, perfectly aligned now, vibrating in harmony. Her lips brushed his, the softest contact, sending a flood of sensation through him that left him gasping. Heat and electricity mingled, racing through his veins and settling low in his abdomen, a pulsing need that threatened to overwhelm him.

And then—darkness.

The second revelation had begun.
