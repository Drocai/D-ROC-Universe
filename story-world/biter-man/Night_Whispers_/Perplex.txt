Launch a very small, very focused test loop before you touch the rest of the deck.

## What to do this week

- **Produce 3 versions of Episode 1**  
  - A: full 45s as scripted.[1][2]
  - B: a 15–20s ultra-hook cut that jumps faster to the twist.[2]
  - C: a “PG-13” cut with slightly toned-down lines for safety testing.[1]

- **Soft-launch on one primary platform first**  
  - Pick TikTok or Reels as the main lab; post A/B/C over 7–10 days at your planned 9 PM slot.[2]
  - Use your killer hook line in every caption + on-screen text: “Real history whispered like dirty secrets in your ear at 2 a.m.”[3]

- **Instrument for learning, not vanity**  
  - Watch: 3-second hold, completion rate, saves, shares, comments with quotes, and any flags.[4][2]
  - Especially track if drop-off spikes during the heartbeat pause; shorten or score it differently if retention dips there.[1]

## What to tweak before scaling

- **Tighten brand-safe language in public-facing pieces**  
  - Keep the deck’s “Horny History” and spicier phrasing, but also add one clean sentence version for brands: “Night Whispers is an ASMR history micro-series that turns real events into addictive late-night storytelling.”[3][2]
  - In captions, alternate between explicit and more playful/clever hooks so you can see which gets you reach without risking bans.[2][3]

- **Clarify the funnel to money early**  
  - In the deck, add one visual that shows: Shorts → Follow → Patreon/“After Dark” feed → Merch (candles, journals, pins).[3][2]
  - Set up at least a basic Patreon tier and a single easy merch item (journal or candle) so early fans have somewhere to go.[2][3]

## After first 3–5 posts

- **Double-down if early signals match your comps**  
  - If any cut clears, say, 20–30% watch-through and strong saves/shares at small scale, commit to your 3x/week schedule for a month.[4][2]
  - Use the highest-performing lines as recurring “series staples” and put them in your bio and channel banner.[3]

If you tell which platform you want to prioritize first (TikTok, Reels, or Shorts), next step can be concrete: exact posting calendar, 3 captions, and thumbnail text for your first week.[2][3]
