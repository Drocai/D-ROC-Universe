Here are the most relevant and up-to-date comparable series metrics (as of late 2025/early 2026 data) for the formats you referenced in the Night Whispers: Horny History concept. These draw from established channels/apps in overlapping niches: comedic/edutainment history (like Drunk History and Weird History), pure ASMR (like Gibi ASMR), and erotic audio storytelling (like Dipsea and Quinn). I’ve pulled from reliable sources like Social Blade, HypeAuditor, VidIQ, and industry reports to give a realistic benchmark picture.
These metrics show strong proof-of-concept: history mash-ups and ASMR both drive massive views/subscribers with low production overhead, while erotic audio apps demonstrate high revenue per user through subscriptions. Your series sits at the intersection — educational history + whisper/ASMR delivery + light erotic framing — which could capture spillover from all three.
1. Drunk History (Comedic History Edutainment)
•  Original Web Series Roots → FunnyOrDie/YouTube shorts led to Comedy Central TV adaptation (2013–2020, 7 seasons).
•  YouTube Metrics (main channel and clips): Individual popular episodes/clips often hit 1–15 million views (e.g., spy stories or celebrity reenactments). Full episodes from TV uploads average hundreds of thousands to low millions.
•  Overall Impact → Helped popularize “drunk narration + reenactments” format; many clips still circulate virally years later. No current active channel stats dominate, but legacy shows 10M+ views on standout episodes.
•  Relevance to Your Series → Proves history + twist (humor here, sensuality for you) can go viral in short-form. High shareability from quotable/re-enactable moments.
2. Weird History (Straightforward “Weird” History Shorts)
•  Subscribers → ~4.67 million (as of mid-late 2025).
•  Total Views → ~695 million across 1,021 videos.
•  Average Video Performance → Videos commonly get 100K–1M+ views; top ones (e.g., quirky death causes or odd facts) exceed 10–15 million. Likes average ~2.5K–3K per video.
•  Growth → Steady uploads (often weekly) drive consistent gains; added ~280K subs in periods of strong content.
•  Relevance → Pure “weird/untold history” shorts format mirrors your factual core + twist. Shows low-cost, animated/narrated history can scale to millions of views/subscribers without celebrity reenactments.
3. Gibi ASMR (Top-Tier ASMR Roleplay/Whisper Content)
•  Subscribers → ~5.19–5.2 million (consistent across 2025–2026 reports).
•  Total Views → ~2.4 billion (lifetime).
•  Average Video Views → Recent videos: 100K–300K+ (e.g., roleplays or improv sessions hit 200K–300K quickly).
•  Monthly Earnings Estimate → $25K–$75K (YouTube ads + other streams), with some reports showing $3.5K–$4.8K in quieter months.
•  Engagement → Strong retention (long videos ~20–40 mins); high comment/like rates for ASMR niche.
•  Relevance → Whisper/ASMR delivery is your core audio hook. Gibi proves immersive, roleplay-style content (even non-erotic) builds loyal, binge-watching audiences with high watch time — perfect for your bedtime/nighttime positioning.
4. Dipsea & Quinn (Erotic Audio Storytelling Apps)
•  Dipsea (audio erotica, acquired by RevenueCat in 2024):
	•  Revenue: Limited public figures, but similar apps show strong subscription traction.
	•  Users/Downloads: No exact 2025/2026 numbers, but part of booming erotic audio space (tied to broader app revenue growth).
•  Quinn (audio erotica, user-generated + originals, celebrity collabs):
	•  Annual Recurring Revenue → Surpassed $11 million by August 2024 (440% YoY growth reported in prior years).
	•  User Metrics → Heavy Gen Z skew (56% users 18–24); monthly listening ~24 million minutes.
	•  Pricing → $4.99/month or $47.99/year — high conversion from free tier to paid.
	•  Growth → Viral TikToks + celebrity originals (e.g., Andrew Scott, Kate Moennig) drive surges.
•  Relevance → Proves paid erotic audio has real revenue potential (subscriptions convert well when content feels premium/personal). Your free YouTube shorts could funnel users to Patreon/uncensored versions for monetization upside.
Broader ASMR Niche Stats (Context for Whisper Appeal)
•  Overall Views → ASMR category has billions of cumulative views; top videos/categories (roleplays, personal attention) average 4M+ views.
•  Engagement → ~4% average rate (higher than general YouTube content).
•  Growth → 150%+ viewership increase on TikTok in recent years; new channels still emerging, but top ones dominate.
Key Takeaways for Night Whispers Positioning
•  Low Barrier to Scale → Weird History (4.7M subs, 695M views) and Gibi (5.2M subs, 2.4B views) show narrated/short-form content can hit millions without high production budgets.
•  Viral + Retention Power → Drunk History clips prove twist + history = shareable; ASMR adds binge/retention.
•  Revenue Upside → Quinn’s $11M+ ARR on subscriptions shows erotic framing can monetize directly (beyond ads).
•  Edge Cases → History niches risk slower initial growth but strong loyalty; ASMR/erotic risk platform flags — your faceless/abstract visuals help mitigate.
•  Implications → Realistic early targets: 50K–100K views/episode in first months (via viral hooks), scaling to 500K+ with consistency. Monetization could hit thousands/month via ads + Patreon once at 100K+ subs.
These comps validate the hybrid approach — history gives credibility, whispers/ASMR give tingles/retention, erotic tease gives shareability/addiction. If you want deeper dives on any (e.g., specific episode views or growth curves), or help benchmarking your own early metrics, let me know!
