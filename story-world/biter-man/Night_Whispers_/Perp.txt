For TikTok, lead with the hook, test intensity, and optimize around watch time and shares.

## Week 1 posting plan

- Post 3 times: Mon, Wed, Fri at 9 PM EST, using your planned cadence.[1]
- Video 1: Full 45s Catherine pilot as scripted; use the candle/velvet visuals from your blueprint.[2]
- Video 2: 15–20s “dirty secret at 2 a.m.” teaser cut that jumps quicker to “allegedly insatiable” and a softer version of the twist.[3][2]
- Video 3: 45s again, but with one or two lines toned down for safety, to see if flags/retention change.[1][2]

## Captions and on-screen text

- Use your killer hook in every bio/caption this week: “Real history whispered like dirty secrets in your ear at 2 a.m.”[3]
- Three ready-to-paste captions:  
  - “Real history whispered like dirty secrets in your ear at 2 a.m. Catherine the Great was… not just a ruler. 👀 #NightWhispers #HornyHistoryLessons”[2][3]
  - “It’s educational, officer. You just happen to leave a little… hornier and smarter. #ASMRHistory #NightWhispers”[3]
  - “What they didn’t teach you feels so good to know. Sweet dreams, darling. #HornyHistoryLessons #CatherineTheGreat”[2][3]

## Hook, visuals, and safety

- Start the video visually black with a single candle + “Shh… they’re asleep. But we’re not.” as on-screen text in your gothic serif; this fits your aesthetic and catches thumb-stoppers.[1][2]
- Keep visuals strictly abstract: wax, sheets, ropes, silhouettes, but no explicit body parts; this follows your own risk plan to avoid flags while staying suggestive.[1][2]

## What to watch in TikTok analytics

- Prioritize: 3s hold, percentage watched, rewatches, shares, and saves; de-prioritize raw likes early.[4]
- If you see a big drop at the heartbeat pause, test a version where the pause is shorter or has a whispered line over it to keep them hooked.[4][2]

If you want, next step can be: exact 15–20s teaser script for TikTok (voice lines + timing) cut from your Catherine episode.[2][3]
