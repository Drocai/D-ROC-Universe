# HUSH: The Voiced Ones - Brand Guide

## Logo

![HUSH Logo](/home/ubuntu/hush_logo.png)

The HUSH logo represents the core concept of the franchise: voice as power. The cracked marble effect with opal iridescence glowing from within symbolizes the breaking of silence and the emergence of voice as a transformative force. The sound wave motifs represent the physical manifestation of sound in a world of silence.

## Logo Usage

### Clear Space
Always maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "H" in "HUSH" to ensure visual impact and legibility.

### Minimum Size
To maintain legibility, the logo should never be reproduced smaller than 1 inch (25mm) in width for print or 100 pixels for digital applications.

### Incorrect Usage
- Do not stretch or distort the logo
- Do not change the logo colors outside of the approved palette
- Do not remove or separate elements of the logo
- Do not add effects such as drop shadows or outlines
- Do not place the logo on visually cluttered backgrounds

A flowing script that suggests the movement of sound waves, used sparingly for impact.

## Visual Elements

### Sound Wave Motifs
Sound waves can be used as graphic elements throughout branded materials, either as borders, dividers, or background elements. They should appear to be transforming into landscapes or character silhouettes when possible.

### Cracked Marble Texture
This texture represents the breaking of silence and can be used as a background element or for special edition materials.

### Opal/Iridescent Accents
Subtle iridescent highlights should be used to suggest magic and voice, particularly when highlighting important elements.

## Brand Voice

### Tone
- Poetic yet accessible
- Mysterious but not obtuse
- Emotionally resonant without being melodramatic
- Balancing darkness with moments of beauty and hope

### Key Messaging
- "In a world of silence, a whisper is a revolution."
- "Find your voice. Change your world."
- "Some sounds can't be silenced."
- "The power of voice in a world of silence."

## Application Examples

### Book Covers
The series covers should feature the character portraits with the HUSH logo prominently displayed. Each book should incorporate the color associated with the featured Voiced One.

### Website
The website should use a dark background (Obsidian Black) with iridescent accents and sound wave animations that respond to user interaction.

### Social Media
Profile pictures should use the logo mark only, while cover images can feature character art with sound wave elements. Posts should incorporate the brand colors and typography whenever possible.

### Merchandise
Merchandise should emphasize the visual contrast between darkness and light, featuring character-specific color schemes and sound wave motifs.
