*A 45-minute pilot episode for streaming platforms*

---

## COLD OPEN

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. QUIETHAVEN VILLAGE - DAWN**

*The sun rises over a peaceful village on the Silent Plains. White stone buildings catch the golden light. The only sounds are natural - wind, birds, the distant bleating of livestock.*

*PEOPLE move through the streets in flowing robes, their movements graceful and deliberate. They communicate through an elegant sign language - ASEMIC - their hands dancing through the air like poetry.*

**INT. HUSH'S FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN - DAWN**

*HUSH (23), bronze-skinned with opal eyes that shift color in the light, sits at a wooden table. Her adoptive mother MIRA (50s) places a bowl of porridge before her.*

*Mira's hands move in Asemic: "You seem troubled, daughter."*

*Hush responds in kind: "Strange dreams again. Sounds that don't exist."*

*Mira's expression grows concerned. She glances toward the door, then back to Hush.*

*Mira signs: "The mind sometimes creates what the body cannot. It is natural. It will pass."*

*But Hush's opal eyes flicker with uncertainty.*

**TITLE SEQUENCE**

*The HUSH logo appears as ethereal sound waves ripple across the screen, accompanied by the haunting instrumental theme.*

## ACT ONE

**EXT. QUIETHAVEN VILLAGE SQUARE - MORNING**

*The village square bustles with silent activity. A SEISMIC CONCERT is being prepared - massive resonating instruments that create vibrations felt rather than heard.*

*Hush walks through the crowd, her eyes drawn to a young man, THORNE (25), who is helping to position one of the instruments. Their eyes meet across the square.*

*Thorne approaches, his hands moving in Asemic: "Will you attend the concert tonight?"*

*Hush signs back: "If the elders permit."*

*Their hands brush as they sign, and for a moment, Hush's eyes flash brighter. She pulls back, startled.*

**INT. ELDER'S CHAMBER - DAY**

*Three VILLAGE ELDERS sit in meditation. The eldest, KAEL (60s), Hush's adoptive father, opens his eyes as a MESSENGER enters.*

*The Messenger signs urgently: "Word from the Obsidian Desert. The Silent Surgeons request a census of all young women. They seek... anomalies."*

*The Elders exchange worried glances.*

*Kael signs: "What kind of anomalies?"*

*Messenger: "Those who show signs of... vocal corruption."*

*The word 'vocal' is signed with visible distaste, as if the very concept is contaminating.*

**EXT. WHISPERING PEAKS - DAY**

*High in the mountains, SHRIEK (25) sits alone on a cliff edge. Her white hair whips in the wind, and her neon-blue veins pulse faintly beneath her skin.*

*She watches an avalanche in the distance - one she caused with a scream of frustration hours earlier. Her electric blue eyes are filled with self-loathing.*

*She stands and walks toward a small cave that serves as her shelter, passing markers she's carved into the rock - a tally of days in exile.*

**INT. SUNKEN SEA RUINS - DAY**

*MONA (28) explores the flooded ruins of an ancient city. Her pale lavender skin glows faintly in the underwater light filtering through broken windows.*

*She discovers an artifact - a crystalline device covered in symbols from the Age of Chatter. As her fingers touch it, she involuntarily releases a soft, haunting moan.*

*The artifact begins to glow, and suddenly the ruins around her shimmer with ghostly images of the past - people speaking, laughing, singing. The vision overwhelms her, and she drops the artifact, the images fading.*

**INT. TRAVELING CIRCUS WAGON - DAY**

*LAFFY (22) practices acrobatic routines inside a colorfully decorated wagon. Her hair shifts from golden to purple as her mood changes with each movement.*

*An older woman, VERA (60s), the circus matriarch, enters.*

*Vera signs: "The authorities are asking questions in the next town. About unusual sounds."*

*Laffy's spiral eyes spin with concern: "How much do they know?"*

*Vera: "Enough to be dangerous. We may need to change our route."*

**EXT. WEEPING FOREST - DAY**

*SOBA (45) sits beneath an ancient tree whose branches weep golden sap. Her translucent skin seems to merge with the mist around her.*

*She tends to a small garden of rare plants, each one responding to her presence with subtle movements. A wounded bird lands near her, and she releases a gentle sigh that seems to heal its wing.*

*The bird flies away, and Soba's silver-gray eyes follow it with a mixture of joy and sadness.*

## ACT TWO

**INT. HUSH'S FAMILY HOME - EVENING**

*Hush prepares for the Seismic Concert, wearing a simple but elegant robe. Mira helps her with her hair.*

*Mira signs: "You are beautiful, daughter. But beauty can be dangerous. Be careful tonight."*

*Hush: "What do you mean?"*

*Mira hesitates, then: "There are stories... of women who are different. Who carry the old corruption in their throats. They are hunted."*

*Hush's hand instinctively goes to her throat.*

**EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT**

*The Seismic Concert begins. Hundreds of villagers sit in concentric circles around the massive instruments. The RESONANCE KEEPERS strike the instruments with padded mallets.*

*Deep, thrumming vibrations fill the air. The audience feels the music in their bones, their faces showing rapture as they experience the shared emotional journey.*

*Hush sits beside Thorne, their hands intertwined. The vibrations seem to affect her differently - her opal eyes swirl with colors, and she appears to be hearing something others cannot.*

**INT. OBSIDIAN DESERT - TEMPLE OF FIRST WORDS - NIGHT**

*ALARENIX (ageless) stands in a circular chamber filled with ancient texts. Her amber skin glows with moving tattoos - words and symbols that shift across her body like living language.*

*She speaks aloud - the first voice we've heard in the episode: "The time approaches. The Whisper stirs. Soon, the silence will break."*

*Her golden eyes reflect knowledge of events unfolding across the continent.*

**EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)**

*As the Seismic Concert reaches its climax, Hush becomes overwhelmed by the sensations. The vibrations seem to unlock something within her.*

*She gasps, and for the first time in the episode, we hear a sound from a human throat - a barely audible whisper: "Beautiful."*

*The word hangs in the air like a physical thing. Several people nearby turn, confused. Thorne stares at her in shock.*

*Hush realizes what she's done. Terror fills her opal eyes.*

**INT. ELDER'S CHAMBER - NIGHT**

*Kael is awakened by urgent knocking. A VILLAGER enters, signing frantically.*

*Villager: "Elder Kael, your daughter... she made a sound. During the concert. People heard."*

*Kael's face goes pale.*

## ACT THREE

**INT. HUSH'S FAMILY HOME - NIGHT**

*Hush sits on her bed, Mira and Kael beside her. All three are visibly shaken.*

*Kael signs: "Tell us exactly what happened."*

*Hush: "I don't know. The vibrations... they felt like they were calling to something inside me. And then... it just came out."*

*Mira: "We must leave. Tonight. Before the Silencers come."*

*Kael: "Where can we go? There is nowhere to hide from this."*

*A distant sound - the rhythmic beating of drums. The Silencers' approach signal.*

**EXT. QUIETHAVEN VILLAGE - NIGHT**

*Torches appear on the horizon. A group of SILENCERS in dark robes approaches the village, led by COMMANDER VOSS (40s), a fanatical enforcer of the Silent Surgeons.*

*The villagers emerge from their homes, forming silent lines as the Silencers enter the square.*

**INT. HUSH'S FAMILY HOME - NIGHT**

*The family hears the commotion outside.*

*Kael: "They're here. Hush, you must run. Now."*

*Hush: "I won't leave you."*

*Mira: "You must. You are more than just our daughter now. You are something the world has forgotten. Something it needs."*

*Kael hands her a small pack: "Go to the Weeping Forest. Find the woman who sighs. She will help you understand."*

**EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT**

*Commander Voss stands before the assembled villagers. He gestures, and one of his Silencers steps forward with a strange device - a SOUND DETECTOR that glows faintly.*

*The device begins to pulse, indicating the presence of recent vocal activity.*

*Voss's cold eyes scan the crowd.*

**EXT. QUIETHAVEN VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT**

*Hush slips through the shadows at the village edge. Behind her, she can see the torches and the gathering in the square.*

*She reaches the forest line and turns back for one last look at her home. In the distance, she sees Thorne being questioned by the Silencers.*

*Their eyes meet across the distance. Thorne's expression is torn between love and fear.*

**INT. WEEPING FOREST - NIGHT**

*Hush stumbles through the dark forest, guided only by moonlight filtering through the canopy. She's never been this far from home.*

*She comes to a clearing where an ancient tree weeps golden sap. Beneath it sits Soba, as if she's been waiting.*

*Soba looks up at Hush with knowing silver-gray eyes.*

*Soba signs: "You are the one who whispers."*

*Hush nods, tears streaming down her face.*

*Soba stands and approaches: "Do not fear your gift, child. You are not broken. You are awakening."*

*Soba releases a gentle sigh, and the sound seems to wrap around Hush like a comforting embrace.*

*For the first time since the concert, Hush feels safe.*

**FADE TO BLACK.**
