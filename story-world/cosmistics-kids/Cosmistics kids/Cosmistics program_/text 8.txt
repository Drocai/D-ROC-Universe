I’ll create an HTML version of the COSMISTICS system documentation for you.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I’ve created a comprehensive HTML document that details the complete COSMISTICS system. This interactive reference guide includes:

1. **Professional Styling**: Clean, responsive design with proper heading hierarchy and readable typography
1. **Navigation System**: Interactive table of contents with smooth scrolling to each section
1. **Structured Content**: All information is organized into logical sections with clear headings
1. **Detailed Tables**: Information like frequency mappings and protocols in easy-to-read tables
1. **Complete Curriculum**: Week-by-week breakdown of the entire 9-month program
1. **Technical Specifications**: Detailed information on tools, frequencies, and assessment methods

The HTML format makes this document highly readable and navigable compared to a plain text version. You can view it directly in your browser, and it will adapt to different screen sizes.

All sections from the previous markdown document are preserved with enhanced formatting, making this an ideal reference document for anyone interested in the COSMISTICS system.

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the COSMISTICS system in more detail? Or would you prefer I create an XML version instead?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
