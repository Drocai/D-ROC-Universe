# COSMISTICS: FIELD AMPLIFICATION CARDS

## Complete Design System

### CORE CONCEPT

The Field Amplification Cards serve as quantum tools for consciousness expansion, energy amplification, and reality creation within the COSMISTICS system. Each card functions as both a meditation focus and a manifestation tool, embedded with specific frequencies, sacred geometry, and intention-setting capabilities.

**2. Manifestation Series (7 Cards)**

- **Purpose**: Creation and reality engineering
- **Frequency Range**: 639-963 Hz (Throat to Crown)
- **Primary Use**: Intention setting and manifestation acceleration

**3. Expansion Series (5 Cards)**

- **Purpose**: Consciousness expansion and higher awareness
