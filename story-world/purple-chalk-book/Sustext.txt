SUSPECT MISDIRECTION:
✅ MAKE EVERYONE ELSE SUSPICIOUS:
The detective/protagonist should be the LEAST suspicious character to the reader. All evidence, all suspicious behavior, all mysterious actions should point to OTHER characters.
JENNA PARK (Primary Red Herring):
	∙	Red hair (purple in neon light?)
	∙	Chemistry knowledge (could synthesize chalk compound)
	∙	Shows up at scenes early/unexpectedly
	∙	Disappears at odd times
	∙	Too helpful, too perfect
	∙	Defensive when questioned
	∙	Mysterious past (dead sister)
	∙	Make readers suspect HER above all others
Other Suspects to Build:
	∙	Justin (guilty behavior, secrets, covering something up)
	∙	Dr. Sarah Kim (evasive, scared, created the chalk compound)
	∙	Rex Torres (street artist, has means and opportunity)
	∙	Other precinct members (access to case files, inside knowledge)
The Detective (Reader) Should Seem:
	∙	Dedicated, thorough, justice-driven
	∙	Obsessed with solving the case (in a good way)
	∙	Protective of innocents
	∙	The one HUNTING the killer, never the killer themselves
	∙	Occasionally tired/overworked (rationalized normally)
