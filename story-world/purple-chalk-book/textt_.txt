EMOTIONAL DEPTH (Intimate Storytelling):
Per the userStyle, writing must have passionate, emotionally nuanced storytelling with psychological complexity.
Focus on:
	∙	Internal experience (thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations)
	∙	Contradictory emotions coexisting
	∙	Subtext in interactions (what’s NOT said matters)
	∙	Metaphorical language that deepens meaning
	∙	Vulnerability and human connection
	∙	Psychological complexity (defense mechanisms, rationalizations, self-deception)
Example:
❌ “Talking to Jenna about the case. She makes a joke. Annoying.”
✅ “Jenna’s laugh cuts through the tension—too loud, too bright, trying too hard. The joke lands flat but she doesn’t seem to notice, or maybe she does and that’s why she keeps talking, filling the silence with noise. There’s something underneath the performance. Something sharp and watching. Or maybe that’s paranoia talking. Hard to tell anymore.”
Techniques:
	∙	Use internal conflict: “Want to trust her. Can’t afford to.”
	∙	Show physical manifestations of emotion: “Jaw clenched. Hands steady through force of will.”
	∙	Layer meaning: “Her eyes track movement. Innocent curiosity? Or cataloging details?”
	∙	Use metaphor: “The conversation feels like walking on glass—beautiful surface, threat underneath.”
