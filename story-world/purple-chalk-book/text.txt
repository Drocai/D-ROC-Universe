📖 MYSTERY MECHANICS - WHAT TO SHOW
SUBTLE SELF-CLUES (That Feel Normal):
The detective experiences things that COULD indicate they’re the killer, but every single one has a rational explanation they (and the reader) can believe.
✅ Obsessed with the chalk (everyone else dismisses it as street art)
	∙	Spending hours analyzing it, mapping patterns, tracking timing
	∙	This makes the detective seem THOROUGH, not suspicious
	∙	Frame as: dedicated investigator following a hunch everyone else ignores
✅ Brief “naps” throughout the day (NOT blackouts)
	∙	Frame as: exhaustion from overwork, stress from the case
	∙	“Closing eyes for two minutes. Maybe five. The case file still open when waking.”
	∙	NOT mysterious loss of time, just fatigue
✅ “Lost track of time” moments (deep focus, not amnesia)
	∙	“Three hours passed reviewing evidence. Felt like thirty minutes.”
	∙	Frame as: getting absorbed in work, flow state
	∙	Common detective experience, not supernatural
✅ Arriving at scenes early (good instincts)
	∙	“Something pulled attention to this alley. Intuition? Pattern recognition?”
	∙	Frame as: experienced investigator following gut feelings
	∙	Could also suggest someone ELSE tipped them off (make that suspicious)
✅ Knowing things without clear source (good memory, thorough file review)
	∙	“The victim’s connection to Synapse Labs surfaces in memory. Must have been in one of the files.”
	∙	Frame as: subconscious processing, detail-oriented investigation
	∙	NOT supernatural knowledge
✅ Defending The Chalker’s logic (moral complexity)
	∙	“What if the victims deserved it? The thought surfaces, unwanted.”
	∙	Frame as: detective wrestling with justice vs. law
	∙	Philosophical question, not self-defense
✅ 528 Hz triggers headaches (frequency sensitivity)
	∙	“The sound drills into temples. Sharp. Immediate. Has to leave.”
	∙	Frame as: physical sensitivity, maybe related to stress
	∙	NOT a supernatural trigger
✅ Dreams of the deaths (stress, case obsession)
	∙	“The dreams come every night now. Victims falling. Purple light. Wake up cold.”
	∙	Frame as: subconscious processing case details, PTSD-like symptoms
	∙	Normal for someone immersed in murder investigation
✅ Chalk feels “familiar” (déjà vu, overthinking)
	∙	“Something about the glow. Like seeing it before. Shake it off. Impossible.”
	∙	Frame as: pattern recognition, or just exhaustion playing tricks
	∙	Dismiss it immediately
✅ Wake up in odd positions/locations (fell asleep working​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
