SHOW, DON’T TELL:
Never name emotions or states. Show them through sensory detail, physical sensation, and behavior.
❌ “The city felt oppressive and sad.”
✅ “Neon bled into oil slicks. Steam rose from grates like the city exhaling its last breath. The rain never stopped. Never cleaned anything.”
❌ “Feeling obsessed with the chalk.”
✅ “Three hours staring at the outline. The case file forgotten. Everyone else went home. The chalk still glows.”
❌ “Guilty about ignoring Justin’s warning.”
✅ “Justin’s voice echoes. That warning tone, dismissed. The chest tightens—not quite guilt. Something sharper. Something without a name yet.”
