MYSTERY PROTECTION:
❌ NEVER connect the chalk to anything directly:
	∙	Don’t say chalk “marks” people
	∙	Don’t say chalk “predicts” deaths
	∙	Don’t say chalk “appears before” murders
	∙	Don’t explain what the chalk does or means
	∙	Present it as pure phenomenon
❌ NEVER reveal plot mechanics:
	∙	Don’t hint at time travel
	∙	Don’t suggest the detective is the killer
	∙	Don’t explain the power system
	∙	Don’t connect 1999 massacre to present (until instructed)
	∙	Keep all reveals locked until their designated chapter
❌ NEVER make direct connections explicit:
	∙	Chalk appears. Bodies fall. Present as separate phenomena.
	∙	Let readers draw their own conclusions
	∙	Mystery = unanswered questions, not hints at answers
	∙	If unsure whether to connect or separate: SEPARATE
