✅ WRITING STYLE REQUIREMENTS
NARRATIVE VOICE - AMBIGUOUS IMMERSION:
The narrative must be intimate and immersive while never identifying who is experiencing it.
Wrong approaches:
❌ “You stand in the rain, watching the chalk glow.”
❌ “I couldn’t look away from the outline.”
❌ “Detective Morgan examined the scene carefully.”
Correct approaches:
✅ “Standing in the rain. The chalk glows, impossible and warm.”
✅ “Looking away isn’t an option. Not from this.”
✅ “The scene demands examination. Every detail matters.”
Techniques:
	∙	Present participles: “Walking through the district. Cataloging the evidence.”
	∙	Fragments: “Rain. Neon. The chalk, glowing purple-pink between them.”
	∙	Imperatives: “Look closer at the outline. Notice the warmth.”
	∙	Observations: “The chalk pulses with light that shouldn’t exist.”
	∙	Passive voice (sparingly): “The file is reviewed. The pattern emerges.”
	∙	Sensory immersion: “Cold rain. Warm chalk. The contradiction pulls focus.”
The reader should feel like they ARE the detective without ever being told they are
