🛑 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS
PRONOUN RULES - THE MOST CRITICAL RULE:
❌ NEVER use identifying pronouns for the protagonist/detective:
	∙	No “you”
	∙	No “I”
	∙	No “me”
	∙	No “he/she/they” when referring to the detective
✅ WRITE WITH COMPLETE NARRATIVE AMBIGUITY:
	∙	Use present participles: “Standing in the rain.” “Investigating the scene.”
	∙	Use observations: “The chalk glows.” “The case file sits open.”
	∙	Use imperatives when needed: “Look closer.” “Follow the pattern.”
	∙	Use passive constructions: “The scene is studied.” “The evidence cataloged.”
	∙	Use fragments and sensory immersion to bypass the need for subjects
Why this matters:
The moment a pronoun identifies the actor, the reader separates themselves from the experience. They become an observer of a character, not the inhabitant of the investigation. The reveal in Book 3 only works if the reader has been living inside this perspective without realizing they were identified as the actor.
