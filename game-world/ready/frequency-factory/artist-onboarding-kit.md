**High Originality, Low Commercial:**
→ Too experimental for mainstream
→ **Solution:** Embrace your lane, find your niche audience

**High Everything Except Replay:**
→ Good on first listen, doesn't stick
→ **Solution:** Strengthen your hook, make it more memorable

**Consistent 7s-8s Across the Board:**
→ Good but not great, missing that "IT" factor
→ **Solution:** Take bigger creative risks, find your unique element

---

### **PART 3: HANDLING FEEDBACK**

#### **The Right Mindset**

**Remember:**
- Ratings are OPINIONS, not facts
- Even hit songs get mixed reviews
- Constructive criticism helps you grow
- One low rating doesn't define you
- Focus on patterns, not outliers

---

#### **Types of Feedback**

**1. Constructive Criticism**
```
Example: "Love the energy, but vocals are buried in the mix"
Your Response: Thank them, consider the feedback
```

**2. Harsh but Honest**
```
Example: "Flow is off-beat, lyrics are cliche"
Your Response: Don't take it personally, assess if it's valid
```

**3. Personal Attacks**
```
Example: "You should quit music"
Your Response: Report if violates guidelines, ignore otherwise
```

**4. Generic Praise**
```
Example: "This is fire! 🔥"
Your Response: Appreciate it, but don't put too much weight on it
```

**5. Detailed Analysis**
```
Example: "Production is clean. Hook at 0:45 is catchy. Consider bringing vocals up 2dB in verse 2. Overall solid track!"
Your Response: GOLD. This is what you want. Take notes.
```

---

#### **What to Do with Feedback**

**Look for Patterns:**
- 3+ people mention same issue? → Probably valid
- Split opinions? → Stylistic choice, your call
- Outlier criticism? → Consider but don't obsess

**Action Steps:**
1. **Read all feedback** (don't cherry-pick)
2. **Identify patterns** (common themes)
3. **Separate emotion from analysis** (what's actually being said?)
4. **Make a list** (actionable improvements)
5. **Implement learnings** (in next release)

**Example:**
```
Feedback Received:
- "Vocals too quiet" (5 mentions)
- "Hook is weak" (3 mentions)
- "Beat is fire" (8 mentions)

Action Items for Next Track:
✓ Work with mix engineer on vocal levels
✓ Spend more time on hook writing
✓ Keep working with same producer
```

---

#### **How to Respond to Feedback**

**You CAN:**
- Reply to comments with gratitude
- Ask clarifying questions
- Engage constructively
- Thank reviewers

**You CAN'T:**
- Argue with raters
- Demand higher scores
- Harass users
- Get defensive

**Good Responses:**
✅ "Thanks for the feedback! I'll work on that vocal mix."
