Think of it as a gamified A&R platform that runs alongside your stream.\n\nHere's how it works with your content:\n\n**PRE-SHOW:** Your community rates tracks before you go live. Creates hype, gives them something to do between streams.\n\n**DURING SHOW:** You review the top-rated tracks live. Real-time engagement, instant feedback from the community, they see their ratings influence your content.\n\n**POST-SHOW:** Factory stays active after you sign off. Keeps your audience engaged 24/7, even when you're not streaming.\n\nWhy this works:\n- Your audience gets rewarded for engagement (tokens, ranks, badges)\n- You always have quality tracks to review (community pre-filters)\n- Artists pay for submissions (we split 70/30 in your favor)\n- Your community grows stickier - they're invested even when you're offline\n\nI'm not asking you to change your content. I'm offering a tool that amplifies what you already do.\n\nNo cost to you. Just value add.\n\nInterested in a quick call to see if this fits your show?\n\nDrop a reply or DM me.\n\n- [Your Name]\nFounder, Frequency Factory\n\n[Link to platform demo]\n[Link to partnership deck]",

          "follow_up_2": "(Day 7)\n\nLast message, I promise!\n\nIf Frequency Factory isn't a fit for your show, totally cool - I respect that.\n\nBut if you're at all curious, here's a 2-minute video showing exactly how it integrates with streams: [VIDEO LINK]\n\nEither way, keep doing what you're doing.

The way you broke down [specific element] at [timestamp] was exactly the kind of analysis the music community needs more of.\n\nI'm reaching out because I think there's a natural collaboration between your channel and Frequency Factory.\n\nQuick context: Frequency Factory is a gamified platform where your audience can rate tracks, earn rewards, and help discover new artists. Think SubmitHub meets Twitch culture.\n\nHow this could work with your channel:\n\n**CONTENT PIPELINE:**\n1. Artists submit tracks to Frequency Factory\n2. Your audience rates them (Hook Strength + Production Quality)\n3. Top-rated tracks become your review videos\n4. Your reviews drive more engagement on the platform\n\nResult: You always have quality content to review (community pre-filters), your audience is engaged between uploads, and you earn from submissions.\n\n**REVENUE:**\n- Artists pay to submit tracks ($10-50 depending on tier)\n- You get 70% of submission fees for tracks you review\n- Platform handles all payments, tracking, logistics\n\n**ENGAGEMENT:**\n- Your community gets tokens, ranks, badges\n- They're invested in your content (their ratings matter)\n- Stickier audience, better retention\n\n**YOUR WORKLOAD:**\n- Zero change to your content style\n- Just review tracks the community already validated\n- We handle all tech/support\n\nI'm not trying to change what you do. You're already great at it. I'm just offering infrastructure that makes it easier and more profitable.\n\nWorth exploring?\n\nI put together a partnership deck that shows exactly how this works: [LINK]\n\nOr we can hop on a quick call if you prefer to talk through it.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\nFounder, Frequency Factory\n\n[Platform Link]\n[Partnership Deck]\n[Calendar Link for Meeting]",
