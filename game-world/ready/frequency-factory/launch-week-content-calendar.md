**Email #3 - Education Email (6:00 PM)**
```
Subject: How to Rate Music (Without Being Mean)

Hey [Name],

Rated your first track yet?

If not, here's how to do it RIGHT:

THE GOLDEN RULE:
Be honest, not harsh. Critique the music, not the artist.

GOOD FEEDBACK EXAMPLES:
✅ "Love the energy, but vocals are buried in the mix"
✅ "Beat goes hard, but the hook could be catchier"
✅ "Not my genre, but I respect the craft"

BAD FEEDBACK EXAMPLES:
❌ "This is trash"
❌ "You should quit music"
❌ "Nobody will ever like this"

See the difference?

Honest + Constructive = Valuable
Mean + Destructive = Useless

BONUS TIP:
Leave detailed comments for +5 tokens.
