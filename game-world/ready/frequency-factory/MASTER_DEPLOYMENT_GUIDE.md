## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. CONSISTENCY OVER PERFECTION
Don't wait for perfect. Post consistently. The algorithm rewards consistency over polish.

### 2. ENGAGE IMMEDIATELY
Respond to every comment in the first hour. The algorithm notices. Community appreciates it.

### 3. DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS
Track everything. Double down on what works. Kill what doesn't. No emotions, just data.

### 4. AUTHENTIC VOICE
Use the Frequency Factory brand voice: Direct, industrial, inclusive, competitive, authentic. Never fake it.

### 5. COMMUNITY FIRST
Everything you create should serve the community. Users, artists, partners. If it's just for you, it fails.

### 6. ITERATE FAST
Test. Learn. Adjust. Repeat. Don't get attached to any specific piece of content. Be willing to pivot.
