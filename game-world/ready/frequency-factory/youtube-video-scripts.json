And what I learned about why some tracks work and others don't is going to change how you think about making music.\n\nStick around because I'm breaking down the patterns, showing you the certified tracks, and explaining exactly what separates a hit from a miss.\n\nLet's get into it.",
        
        "00:30_01:30_setup": "Quick context: Frequency Factory is a platform where anyone can become an A&R operative. You listen to submitted tracks, rate them on Hook Strength and Production Quality, earn tokens, climb ranks.\n\nI'm an Executive rank now, which means I've rated hundreds of tracks. But today I wanted to do something different - marathon 50 tracks in one session and see what patterns emerge.\n\nSo I clocked in, grabbed my headphones, and started rating. Here's what happened.",
        
        "01:30_09:00_main_content": "[SECTION 1: THE CERTIFIED TRACKS (3 mins)]\n\"Out of 50 tracks, only 3 hit Factory Certified status - that's a 90+ average rating. Let me show you why these worked.\"\n\n[Play snippet of Track 1]\n\"Track 1: This hook hits at 0:06. Six seconds. That's the magic window. If you don't grab people by then, they're scrolling. Listen to this...\"\n[Break down the hook, explain why it works]\n\"Hook: 9.3/10. Production: 9.0/10. This is getting certified.\"\n\n[Repeat for Tracks 2 and 3]\n\n[SECTION 2: THE COMMON MISTAKES (3 mins)]\n\"Now let's talk about why 35 of these 50 tracks got below an 8. Here are the 5 patterns I saw over and over:\n\n1. THE LATE HOOK PROBLEM\n[Show examples]\n\"12 tracks didn't get to the hook until after 30 seconds. That's way too late. In 2025, you have 10 seconds max. Fix this and your ratings jump immediately.\"\n\n2. MUDDY VOCAL MIXING\n[Show examples]\n\"I couldn't understand the lyrics in 8 different tracks. Not because of accent or style - because the vocals were buried in the mix. EQ your vocals. Make them clear. Non-negotiable.\"\n\n[Continue with other patterns: blown out mastering, generic beats, off-key vocals]\n\n[SECTION 3: THE SURPRISING DISCOVERIES (2 mins)]\n\"But here's what shocked me: 5 tracks that I initially wanted to skip turned out to be really good after I gave them 30 more seconds.\"\n[Examples]\n\"This teaches us something: Sometimes great music doesn't follow the formula. Sometimes it builds. Sometimes it rewards patience.\n\nBut - and this is critical - if you're going to break the rules, everything else needs to be perfect. Your production, your mix, your performance. You don't get to be experimental AND sloppy.\"\n\n[Show specific examples of rule-breaking tracks that worked]",

        "11:00_12:00_outro": "So what did I learn from rating 50 tracks in one day?\n\n1. Great hooks are rare. When you have one, you know immediately.\n2. Production mistakes are fixable. Hook problems are fundamental.\n3. Most artists are closer to success than they think - they just need better feedback.\n4. The community ratings at Frequency Factory are shockingly accurate. Collective wisdom is real.\n\nIf you're an artist, submit your track. Link in description. Let the factory rate it. Get real feedback from real listeners.\n\nIf you're a music fan, become an operative. Link in description. Start rating. Earn tokens.

        "00:30_02:00_framework": "First, understand what you're actually rating:\n\nFrequency Factory has two metrics:\n1. Hook Strength (1-10)\n2. Production Quality (1-10)\n\nThese aren't random. These are the two things that predict commercial success.\n\nHook = Can people remember and sing this?\nProduction = Does it sound professional?\n\nEverything else - lyrics, genre, style, message - that's subjective. But hooks and production? Those are measurable.\n\nLet me show you how to evaluate each one.",
        
        "02:00_06:00_hook_training": "[HOOK STRENGTH MASTERCLASS]\n\n\"The hook is the most important 10 seconds of any song. Here's how to rate it:\n\n1. THE 10-SECOND TEST\n[Play example]\n\"Can you remember any part of this after 10 seconds? If yes, it's at least a 7. If no, it's below 6.\"\n\n2. THE HUM TEST\n[Play example]\n\"Could you hum this hook back to me right now? If yes, it's 8+. If no, it's below 7.\"\n\n3. THE VIRAL POTENTIAL TEST\n[Play example]\n\"Could you see this being used in TikTok videos? Could you imagine people singing along? If yes, it's 9+.\"\n\n4. THE TIMING TEST\n[Play examples]\n\"When does the hook hit? \n- 0-10 seconds = Perfect (9-10 potential)\n- 10-20 seconds = Good (7-9 potential)\n- 20-30 seconds = Late (6-8 potential)\n- 30+ seconds = Too late (below 7)\"\n\n5. THE REPETITION TEST\n[Play example]\n\"Listen twice. Does it get better or worse the second time? If better or same = 8+. If worse = below 7.\"\n\nPRACTICE EXERCISE:\n[Play 3 hooks, pause, ask viewers to rate, then reveal community ratings and explain]\n\n\"See? You're already getting better.\",
        
        "06:00_09:30_production_training": "[PRODUCTION QUALITY MASTERCLASS]\n\n\"Production is about technical execution. Here's what to listen for:\n\n1. VOCAL CLARITY\n[Bad example vs Good example]\n\"Can you hear every word clearly? If no = below 7. If yes = 7+.\"\n\n2. MIX BALANCE\n[Bad example vs Good example]\n\"Is anything too loud or too quiet? If everything sits perfectly = 8+. If something's buried or overpowering = below 7.\"\n\n3. MASTERING\n[Bad example vs Good example]\n\"Does it sound loud enough without distorting? If yes = 7+. If it's quiet or clipping = below 7.\"\n\n4. SONIC SPACE\n[Good example]\n\"Can you hear each element (vocals, drums, bass, melody) distinctly? If yes = 8+.\"\n\n5. PROFESSIONAL COMPARISON\n[Compare indie track to major label track]\n\"Could this play on the radio next to a major label release and hold its own? If yes = 9+. If it sounds amateur in comparison = below 8.\"\n\nPRACTICE EXERCISE:\n[Play 3 tracks, pause, ask viewers to rate production, reveal ratings and explain]\",
