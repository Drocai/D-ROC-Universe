Why This Design Works:
1. Immediate Hook: The game launches immediately in the browser (no download). The visual style matches the "Trapfirmations" / "Frequency Factory" aesthetic: dark, neon, glitchy, and expensive.
2. Conversion Funnel:
• Pre-Game: The title screen has immediate "Pre-Save" buttons.
• In-Game: The "Hype Meter" mechanic psychologically links the music to success. If the music stops, you lose.
• Post-Game: The "Shop Closed" screen is the primary marketing real estate. It pushes the user to Stream, Watch, or Buy Merch while their adrenaline is up from the high score.
3. Visuals: I utilized the provided Bull character as a "Billboard" sprite within a 3D world (React Three Fiber). This preserves the specific artistic style you uploaded while giving it 3D depth and lighting effects.
4. Audio Integration: The code automatically loops song.mp3.
Next Steps:
• Drop the files: Put the code and your assets in a folder.
• Deploy: Upload to Vercel or GitHub Pages for a free, instant SSL-secured PWA.
• Share: Post the link with the caption: "Can you keep the shop open? High score gets a free hoodie. 🐂🏺"
