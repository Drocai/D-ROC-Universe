DUMB BULL IN A CHINA SHOP - GAME ASSET MANIFEST
To make your game look and sound perfect, you need to add the
following files to the same folder as your 'index.html':
1. CHARACTER SPRITES (From your upload)
1. Rename your uploaded character images to match these filenames.
The game code looks for these exact names:
• bull_1.png  (Use for the main running character)
• bull_2.png  (Optional: Can be used for "Smashing" frame)
1. Note: Ensure they are transparent PNGs for the best look.
2. MUSIC TRACK (From your previous Zip)
2. Locate "Dumb Bull in a China Shop D RoC.mp3" from the
previous extraction we did.
• Rename it to: song.mp3
• Place it in the same folder.
3. OPTIONAL: CHINA TEXTURES
3. The game currently uses 3D primitives for the "China".
If you want custom vases, add a texture named:
• vase_texture.jpg

HOW TO HOST THIS (PWA)
