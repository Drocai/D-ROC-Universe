SYNTAX SOUL — Vertical Slice Prototype (Vite + React + TypeScript)

Run:
  npm i
  npm run dev

What you can test NOW:
- Create/rename a Soul
- Equip shards
- Train (Word Fuel + Cadence Gym)
- Explore a node-map (Train/Battle/Shop/Boss)
- NPC battles (best-of-3) with judge breakdown + loot
- Async friend battles via shareable "Turn Code" JSON (no backend)
- Persistent save via localStorage

Notes:
- Bar generation is deterministic templates + packs to feel like “training” today.
- Later you can swap to constrained LLM generation behind the same contract.
